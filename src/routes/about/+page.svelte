<p>I mainly do Minecraft related things and I try to learn new things.</p>

<h1>
    My interests
</h1>

<p>
    I could talk a lot about what I like, but I'm going to try to keep it short and simple :
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Programming</li>
    <li>Video games</li>
    <li>Music</li>
    <li>Art</li>

</ul>

<p>
    I'm also interested about learning new things, so if you want to talk about anything , feel free to contact me !
</p>

<h1>
    My skills
</h1>

<p>
    Recently I've been working a lot with web languages like HTML, CSS, JS and framework like Svelte or Vuejs. But I also have some experience with Java, Python, C and Rust.
    I want to learn more about Rust and Go in the future and I also want to learn more about web security as I'm really interested in this field.
